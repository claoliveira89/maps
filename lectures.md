# LECTURES

## 49. What's a Map?
- It's a collection of key/value pairs;
- Both keys and values are staticly typed: all the keys have to be the same type such as all the values. But keys and values does not have to be the same type.

## 50. Manipulating Maps
- We should always use the square braces syntax with maps:

        $   colors["white"] = "#ffffff"
